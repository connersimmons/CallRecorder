# CallRecorder
The application supports 3 modes of work:
Background mode - automatically records all calls;
On shake - launch the voice recorder by shaking the phone;
On button - launching the recorder by button.

All recorded files are stored in the internal storage in the CallRecorder folder.

The “On shake” and “On Button” modes can also be used to record at any time, that is, as a normal voice recorder. To do this, uncheck "Start mode only with call" in the settings.

Shake mode uses an accelerometer built into the phone to detect shakes. In the settings there are the following parameters for setting this mode: "Count of shake" is the number of shake after which recording will begin; "Sensitivity" is the parameter responsible for the sensitivity of the accelerometer; “Vibration” is the parameter responsible for the vibration for each shake.

ATTENTION: before use, select the audio source suitable for your phone in the settings. If you do not record the voice of your interlocutor, then turn on the speakerphone in the settings. He will automatically when you start recording to increase the volume of the interlocutor when you call.

In the future we plan to add the built-in file manager and additional modes of work.
